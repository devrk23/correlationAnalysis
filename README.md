A Correlation Analysis on the Depression and the frequency of engagement in Creative Activities.


This repository contains the final-year capstone project and research article titled **"A Correlation Analysis on Depression and the Frequency of Engagement in Creative Activities"**, conducted as part of the B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering program at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai.

📘 Project Summary

The study investigates the **relationship between depressive symptoms** and **participation in creative activities**, aiming to identify whether individuals experiencing higher levels of depression are more engaged in artistic or expressive practices. It also examines how specific mental health diagnoses influence creative preferences.

🎯 Objectives

- To identify if higher depressive symptoms correlate with greater creative engagement.
- To explore how different mental health diagnoses influence creative domain preferences (e.g., dance, literary arts, visual arts).
- To assess the role of creativity as a coping mechanism.

📊 Methodology

- **Sample Size**: 95 participants aged 18–60.
- **Data Collection**: Google Form survey including demographics, mental health status, creative habits, and coping strategies.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **SPSS**: Spearman's Rank Correlation, Chi-Square Test
  - **R**: Kruskal-Wallis Test, Data Visualization
  - **Python**: Data wrangling and visualizations (Pandas, Seaborn)

📈 Key Statistical Techniques

- **Spearman’s Rank Correlation**: To analyze the relationship between depression levels and creative activity frequency.
- **Chi-Square Test**: To identify relationships between mental health diagnoses and creative domains.
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: To examine differences in creative engagement across different coping groups.

📌 Key Findings

- A **statistically significant positive correlation** (Spearman’s rho = 0.8398, p < 0.001) was found between depressive symptoms and creative activity.
- Participants with **anxiety preferred performing arts**, those with **mood disorders leaned toward literary arts**, and **depressed individuals preferred visual arts**.
- Creative activities emerged as a **prominent coping strategy** compared to social or physical methods.

🔍 Visualizations Included

- **Pie Charts**: Creative domain preferences by diagnosis.
- **Bar Charts**: Coping strategies and frequency of use.
- **Heatmaps**: Correlation between depression levels and engagement frequency.
